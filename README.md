Integrating Real AI API
To integrate with a real AI service (like OpenAI GPT):

Replace the simulated response system in script.js

Add API authentication and request handling

Implement error handling for API failures

Example integration code:

javascript
// Replace the setTimeout function in script.js with:
fetch('https://api.aiservice.com/analyze', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ problem: problemText })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  // Process and display AI response
})
.catch(error => {
  // Handle errors
});
Adding Real Advertisements
Replace advertisement placeholders with actual ad code:

html
<!-- Replace ad-placeholder div with actual ad code -->
<div class="ad-container">
  <h3>Sponsored</h3>
  <!-- Your ad network code here -->
</div>
Browser Compatibility
Chrome (recommended)

Firefox

Safari

Edge

Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
